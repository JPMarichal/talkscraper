        <p>My brothers and sisters, President Hinckley has requested that I now present to you the General Authorities, Area Authority Seventies, and general auxiliary presidencies of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Gordon Bitner Hinckley as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Thomas Spencer Monson as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and James Esdras Faust as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed, if any, may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Thomas Spencer Monson as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Boyd Kenneth Packer as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the following as members of that quorum: Boyd K. Packer, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, Richard G. Scott, Robert D. Hales, Jeffrey R. Holland, and Henry B. Eyring. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. All in favor, please manifest it. Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we extend an official vote of appreciation to Elders Joe J. Christensen and Andrew W. Peterson and designate them as emeritus members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. It is also proposed that we release Elder Christensen as a President of the Quorums of the Seventy. All who wish to join with us in doing so, please manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Elder Ben B. Banks as a member of the Presidency of the Quorums of the Seventy. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we release Elders Max W. Craner, César A. Dávila, P. Bruce Mitchell, and J. Kirk Moyes as Area Authority Seventies. All in favor, please manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain J. Devn Cornish, Manfred H. Schütze, and Johann A. Wondra as Area Authority Seventies. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we release Patricia P. Pinegar, Anne G. Wirthlin, and Susan L. Warner as the Primary general presidency. Those who wish to join in a vote of special appreciation and thanks to these wonderful sisters for their great work, please manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Coleen K. Menlove, Sydney S. Reynolds, and Gayle M. Clegg as the Primary general presidency. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities, Area Authority Seventies, and general auxiliary presidencies as presently constituted. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed may so manifest it.</p>
<p>It appears that the sustaining has been unanimous in the affirmative. Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your faith and prayers.</p>
<p>We now ask the newly called Primary general presidency to take their places on the stand.</p>
