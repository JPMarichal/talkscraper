        <p>Our brethren and sisters, as is customary in the general conference of the Church, we present the General Authorities and general officers of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Ezra Taft Benson as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Gordon B. Hinckley as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and Thomas S. Monson as Second Counselor in the First Presidency.</p>
<p>Those in favor may manifest it. Any opposed may do so.</p>

Ashton, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, James E. Faust, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, and Richard G. Scott.</p>
<p>Those in favor may manifest it. Any opposed may do likewise.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>

<p>In December we announced the calls of Elder Earl C. Tingey as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy and Elders W. Mack Lawrence and Rulon G. Craven as members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy.</p>
<p>Those who wish to join in sustaining these Brethren in these callings, please manifest it. Any who feel otherwise.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that we sustain as members of the First Quorum of the Seventy the following Brethren currently serving as members of the Second Quorum: Alexander B. Morrison, L. Aldin Porter, L. Lionel Kendrick, Monte J. Brough, and Harold G. Hillam.</p>

<p>Changes were made in the Counselors of the General Sunday School Presidency effective January 1. Those who wish to join in a vote of appreciation to Derek A. Cuthbert as First Counselor and H. Verlan Andersen as Second Counselor may indicate.</p>
<p>Those in favor of the calls of Elder H. Verlan Andersen as First Counselor and Elder Rulon G. Craven as Second Counselor in the Sunday School General Presidency, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities and general officers of the Church as presently constituted.</p>
<p>Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed may do so.</p>
<p>It appears that the voting has been unanimous in the affirmative. Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your continued love and confidence.</p>
<p>We invite the newly called members of the Seventy to take their places on the stand at this time.</p>
