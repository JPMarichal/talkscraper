        <p>My brothers and sisters, as requested by President Benson, I shall now present to you the General Authorities and general officers of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain President Ezra Taft Benson as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Gordon B. Hinckley as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and Thomas S. Monson as Second Counselor in the First Presidency.</p>
<p>Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed may manifest it.</p>

<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
<p>All in favor kindly manifest it. Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>With the continued rapid growth of the Church, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve have determined that the time has come to take additional steps to provide for the expansion and regulation of the Church. We announce, therefore, the organization of the Second Quorum of the Seventy, to become effective immediately.</p>
<p>The initial membership of the Second Quorum of the Seventy will be those General Authorities currently serving under a five-year call. Additional Brethren will be added to the Second Quorum of the Seventy from time to time and will serve as Seventies and as General Authorities also under a five-year call.</p>
<p>The First Quorum of the Seventy will continue much as at present, with its members called from the Second Quorum of the Seventy or from the priesthood at large.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain as Presidents of the Seventy: Elders Dean L. Larsen, Marion D. Hanks, Wm. Grant Bangerter, Robert L. Backman, Hugh W. Pinnock, James M. Paramore, and J. Richard Clarke.</p>
<p>Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed?</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain as members of the First Quorum of the Seventy: Elders Theodore M. Burton, Paul H. Dunn, Hartman Rector, Jr., <span class="page-break" data-page="18"></span>Loren C.

Brewerton, Jack H. Goaslind, Angel Abrea, John K. Carmack, Victor L. Brown, H. Burke Peterson, and Hans B. Ringger.</p>
<p>As additional members of the First Quorum of the Seventy: Joe J. Christensen, W. Eugene Hansen, Jeffrey R. Holland, and Marlin K. Jensen.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the following as members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy, who will serve for a period of five years from the time of their initial call: Russell C. Taylor, Robert B. Harbertson, Devere Harris, Spencer H. Osborn, Philip T. Sonntag, John Sonnenberg, F. Arthur Kay, Keith W. Wilcox, Waldo P. Call, Helio da Rocha Camargo, H. Verlan Andersen, George I. Cannon, Francis M. Gibbons, Gardner H. Russell, George R. Hill, III, John R. Lasater, Douglas J. Martin, Alexander B. Morrison, L. Aldin Porter, Glen L. Rudd, Douglas H. Smith, Lynn A. Sorensen, Robert E. Sackley, L. Lionel Kendrick, Monte J. Brough, Albert Choules, Jr., Lloyd P. George, and Gerald E. Melchin.</p>
<p>As additional members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy, who have been called and are being presented at this conference: Carlos H. Amado, Benjamin B. Banks, Spencer J. Condie, F. Melvin Hammond, Malcolm S. Jeppsen, Richard P. Lindsay, Merlin R. Lybbert, and Horacio A. Tenorio.</p>

<p>Those in favor, please manifest it. Those opposed, by the same sign.</p>
<p>President Benson, it appears that the voting has been unanimous in the affirmative.</p>
<p>We invite the newly sustained members of the Seventy to take their places on the stand.</p>
