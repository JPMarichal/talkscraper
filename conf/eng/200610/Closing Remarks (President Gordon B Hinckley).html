        <p>My beloved brothers and sisters, what a miracle these conferences are. There is nothing to compare with them anywhere in the world. When you think that we gather here in this great conference hall and that what we say is carried all across the world so that people on every continent worship together the living God, it is truly and wonderfully a miracle. All who have spoken have done so very well. We wish there had been time to hear from all of the General Authorities. Unfortunately, that has not been possible. Representatives of the auxiliary organizations have inspired us with their messages.</p>
<p>The prayers have likewise inspired us. The music has been simply superb.</p>
<p>We are so grateful for this tremendous Conference Center, this great hall in which to meet, and for the technology which has permitted our words to be carried over the earth to our people in many lands and climes.</p>
<p>We wish that there were peace in the earth and constantly pray that it may come.</p>
<p>Now, our beloved associates, we leave with you our love and our blessing. May the Spirit of the Lord dwell in your homes. May love govern your family relations.</p>
<p>For this we pray as we bid you good-bye for another six months, in the sacred and holy name of our Redeemer, and leave our love and blessing with you, in His name, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
