        <p>Such beautiful singing. I hope you noted the missionary badge on each one, soon to be departing the Missionary Training Center for their assignments all over the world. My brothers and sisters, President Hinckley has requested that I now present to you the General Authorities, Area Seventies, and general auxiliary presidencies of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Gordon Bitner Hinckley as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Thomas Spencer Monson as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and James Esdras Faust as Second Counselor in the First Presidency.</p>
<p>Those in favor may manifest it.</p>
<p>Those opposed, if any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Thomas Spencer Monson as President <span class="page-break" data-page="24"></span>of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Boyd Kenneth Packer as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; and the following as members of that quorum: Boyd K. Packer, L. Tom Perry, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, Richard G. Scott, Robert D. Hales, Jeffrey R. Holland, Henry B. Eyring, Dieter F. Uchtdorf, and David A. Bednar.</p>
<p>Those in favor please manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
<p>All in favor may manifest it.</p>
<p>Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>We extend a release to Elders Ronald T. Halverson, Dale E. Miller, H. Bryan Richards, Donald L. Staheli, David R. Stone, H. Bruce Stucki, Robert J. Whetten, and Richard H. Winkel as members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy.</p>
<p>Those who wish to join with us in expressing appreciation to these Brethren, please manifest it.</p>
<p>With similar appreciation we also extend a release to César A. S. Milder, Hyae-Kee Min, and Masayuki Nakano as Area Seventies.</p>
<p>Those who wish to join with us in doing so, please manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Erich W. Kopischke as a new Area Seventy.</p>
<p>All in favor please manifest.</p>
<p>Any opposed by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities, Area Seventies, and general auxiliary presidencies as presently constituted.</p>
<p>Those in favor please manifest it.</p>
<p>Any opposed may manifest it.</p>
<p>It appears that the sustaining has been unanimous in the affirmative, President Hinckley.</p>
<p>Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your continued faith and prayers.</p>
