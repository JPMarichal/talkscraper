        <p>This, brothers and sisters, is a very solemn occasion. We so approach it and should so conduct it. It will take quite a time; but if we are in the frame of mind and spirit which we should be in, I am sure it will not be tedious.</p>
<p>We are met in the Tabernacle on Temple Square, Salt Lake City, in a formal Solemn Assembly of the body of the Church to express the voice of the Church in a first sustaining vote for a new President of the Church. This proceeding is in accordance with the practice of the Church from the first sustaining vote cast by a General Conference for President John Taylor, until the present time.</p>
<p>The Priesthood of the Church, insofar as the Tabernacle can accommodate them, is seated here by Priesthood quorums.</p>
<p>The First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, with their Assistants, the Patriarch to the Church, the Presidents of the First Council of Seventy, and the Presiding Bishopric occupy their usual seats on the Tabernacle stand.</p>
<p>The <em>Regional Representatives</em> of the Twelve and the <em>Mission Representatives</em> of the Twelve and the First Council of Seventy occupy the seats to the north and south of the stand, both lower seats within the railing and those on the stand level, and the front seats in the body of the hall.</p>
<p>The <em>Patriarchs</em> occupy the seats near the front in the body of the hall.</p>
<p>The <em>High Priests</em> of the Church, including Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors, the High Councilors, the Presidencies and members of quorums, and Ward Bishoprics, occupy the center of the building on the main floor, as far to the eastward as the galleries.</p>
<p>The <em>Seventies</em> occupy the north part of the building on the main floor under the north gallery.</p>
<p>The <em>Elders</em> occupy the south part of the building on the main floor under the galleries.</p>
<p>The <em>Aaronic Priesthood</em> (Priests, Teachers, and Deacons) occupy the seats on the main floor, just back of the High Priests, under the gallery on the east.</p>
<p>The <em>general membership</em> of the Church occupy the rest of the building.</p>
<p>The voting will be by Priesthood quorums first, and then by the Conference assembled.</p>
<p>The quorums and groups of quorums will vote in the following order:</p>
<p>The First Presidency</p>
<p>The Quorum of the Twelve</p>
<p>The High Priests, including the Assistants to the Twelve, Regional Representatives and Mission Representatives, the Presidents of Stakes and their Counselors, the High Councilors, Presidencies of quorums, quorum members, the Presiding Bishopric, and Ward Bishoprics.</p>
<p>The Aaronic Priesthood (Priests, Teachers, and Deacons).</p>
<p>The whole congregation here assembled, including the Priesthood.</p>
<p>The voting will be in the following manner:</p>
<p>As each quorum or group is called, they will be asked to vote to sustain the officer proposed. Those voting will when called upon arise to their feet. When the affirmative vote is called for, those so voting will bring their right arms to the square to manifest to the Lord that they sustain the officer for whom they are voting. They will then drop their hands. Then those opposing will be asked to bring their right arms to the square to bear witness to the Lord that they are not willing to sustain the officer whom they are called upon to sustain.</p>
<p>When both affirmative and negative votes are cast, the members of the quorum will resume their seats.</p>
<p>All of the quorums will vote in this manner.</p>
<p>Everyone is perfectly free to vote as he wishes. There is no compulsion whatsoever in this voting. When you vote affirmatively you make a solemn covenant with the Lord that you will sustain, that is, give your full loyalty and support, without equivocation or reservation, to the officer for whom you vote.</p>
<p>After all the quorums have so voted, a vote will then be called of the whole congregation, those bearing the priesthood and those not bearing it. All will arise. Those voting to sustain will raise their right arms to the square, to witness that they sustain the officers for whom they vote. After they lower their hands the opposing vote will be called for and will be manifested by raising the right arm to the square.</p>
<p>The officers so to be voted for by quorums are the following.</p>
<p>The President of the Church;</p>
<p>The First Counselor to the President of the Church;</p>
<p>The Second Counselor to the President of the Church;</p>
<p>The President of the Quorum of the Twelve;</p>
<p>The Council of the Twelve;</p>
<p>The Patriarch to the Church;</p>
<p>The Sustaining of the Counselors in the Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Patriarch, as Prophets, Seers and Revelators to the Church.</p>
<p>After the vote by quorums to sustain these officers, the rest of the General Authorities, the General Officers of the Church, and the General Auxiliary Officers of the Church will be sustained by voting as in the ordinary General Conference. This is in accordance with the procedure set by President John Taylor.</p>
<p>Please be ready to begin voting. Only Church members are entitled to vote.</p>
<p>Only one quorum, or group of quorums, as the case may be, will stand at a time in voting by quorums. Each quorum, or group of quorums, will please arise when requested and remain standing until requested to be seated.</p>
<p>May the Lord guide us and may His Spirit attend us as we go forward in this solemn service, established by the Lord so that each member of His Church may have a voice in sustaining those whom He has called to preside over it and to direct its work, to the salvation and exaltation of mankind.</p>
