        <p>I believe in sustaining our living prophet, President Gordon B. Hinckley, by listening to and following his counsel.</p>
<p>In general conference last fall, I listened to President Hinckley tell of the emigration of thousands of European Saints who faced their trials “with optimism and enthusiasm” (<em>Ensign,</em> Nov. 1995, 72). He counseled us to do the same.</p>
<p>It was hard advice to hear. At the time I was unhappy, frustrated, and busy feeling sorry for myself.</p>
<p>For months over the summer, I trained to become a member of the varsity volleyball team. I ran, lifted weights, did endless drills. I put in my time. The work paid off. I made the team. My dream was coming true, or so I expected.</p>
<p>Then the dream started to tarnish. Others played better than I did. Much of the time, I warmed the bench, cheering my teammates, yearning to play more, trying to deal with the disappointment.</p>
<p>Life wasn’t being fair. My attitude affected my relationship with the other girls on the team. And it affected how I felt about myself.</p>
<p>Why would Heavenly Father let me work so hard and come so far to end up so disappointed? Finally, after wrestling with my choices and praying for direction, I decided to leave the team. I needed to get back to my studies and my life away from volleyball.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t seem to let go of my disappointment and resentment. Then general conference came. It is a time of year I love because the Spirit is abundant in our home. Conference can be heard in every room.</p>
<p>President Hinckley’s address offered the counsel I needed to put things into perspective. By having an “overpowering spirit of optimism” and enthusiasm (<em>Ensign,</em> Nov. 1995, 72), I could <em>decide</em> to let go of my volleyball experience. I could <em>decide</em> to be positive and optimistic about the many good things in my life: my friendships, my studies, my family. I could play volleyball for <em>fun</em> rather than competition. Suddenly the dilemma that had seemed so overwhelming began to fade. I started to feel better about myself. I read the scriptures more. I prayed more. I liked other people more. I felt the Spirit reenter my life.</p>
<p>I am grateful for a living prophet who taught me to let go of feeling sorry for myself. He quoted Alma 26:35, which teaches us there never was a people “that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began.” I realize now that I have so much to be grateful for, so many reasons to rejoice. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
