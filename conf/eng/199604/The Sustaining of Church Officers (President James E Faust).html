        <p>My brothers and sisters, President Hinckley has requested that I now present to you the General Authorities and general auxiliary presidencies of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Gordon Bitner Hinckley as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Thomas Spencer Monson as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and James Esdras Faust as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed, if any, may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Thomas Spencer Monson as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Boyd Kenneth Packer as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the following as members of that quorum: Boyd K. Packer, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, Richard G. Scott, Robert D. Hales, Jeffrey R. Holland, and Henry B. Eyring. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. All in favor, please manifest. Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>Because of his appointment to serve as president of Brigham Young University, we extend an honorable release to Bishop Merrill J. Bateman as Presiding Bishop, along with his counselors Bishop H. David Burton and Bishop Richard C. Edgley. Those who wish to join with us in a vote of appreciation, please manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the following as new members of the First Quorum of the Seventy: Merrill J. Bateman, Dallas N. Archibald, Dieter F. Uchtdorf, and Bruce C. Hafen. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the following as new members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy: L. Edward Brown, Sheldon F. Child, Quentin L. Cook, William Rolfe Kerr, Dennis E. Simmons, Jerald L. Taylor, Francisco Viñas, and Richard B. Wirthlin. Those in favor, please signify. Opposed, if any, may also so signify.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain H. David Burton as Presiding Bishop, with Richard C. Edgley as First Counselor and Keith B. McMullin as Second Counselor. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities and general auxiliary presidencies as at present constituted. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed may manifest it.</p>
<p>It appears that the sustaining has been unanimous in the affirmative. We invite the new Seventies to take their places on the stand at this time.</p>
<p>Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your loving and prayerful support.</p>
