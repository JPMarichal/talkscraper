<p>It is proposed that we sustain Gordon Bitner Hinckley as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Thomas Spencer Monson as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and James Esdras Faust as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed, if any, by the same sign.</p>

<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency <span class="page-break" data-page="22"></span>and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. All in favor, please manifest it. Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>In view of their assignments to serve in Area Presidencies, it is proposed that we extend an official vote of release and appreciation to Elders Rex D. Pinegar and Charles Didier for their service as members of the Presidency of the Quorums of the Seventy. Those in favor, please manifest it.</p>

<p>It is proposed that we extend an official vote of appreciation to Elders Ted E. Brewerton and Hans B. Ringger and that they be designated as emeritus members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. Those in favor, please manifest it.</p>
<p>With gratitude for their service as General Authorities, it is proposed that we release Elders Eduardo Ayala, LeGrand R. Curtis, Helvécio Martins, J Ballard Washburn, and Durrel A. Woolsey as members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy. Those who wish to join in an expression of appreciation, please indicate by the uplifted hand.</p>
<p>Those who may wish to join us in releasing with a vote of thanks Elders Charles Didier, J Ballard Washburn, and F. Burton Howard as the general Sunday School presidency may so indicate.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain as the general Sunday School presidency Elder Harold G. Hillam as president, Elder F. Burton Howard as first counselor, and Elder Glenn L. Pace as second counselor. Those in favor, please indicate. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities and general auxiliary presidencies as presently constituted. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It appears, President Hinckley, that the voting has been unanimous in the affirmative. Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your loving and prayerful support.</p>
