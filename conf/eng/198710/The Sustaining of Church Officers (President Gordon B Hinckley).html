        <p>I shall now present to you the General Authorities and general officers of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain President Ezra Taft Benson as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Gordon B. Hinckley as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and Thomas S. Monson as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Marion G. Romney as President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, Howard W. Hunter as Acting President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, and the following as members of the Council: Marion G. Romney, Howard W. Hunter, Boyd K. Packer, Marvin J. Ashton, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, James E. Faust, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, and Joseph B. Wirthlin.</p>
<p>Those in favor, please manifest it. Any who may feel opposed may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
<p>All in favor, please manifest it. Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It was announced a few months ago that Elder Jack H. Goaslind has been released as a President of the First Quorum of the Seventy so that he may serve as President of the British Isles–Africa Area of the Church.</p>
<p>Those who wish to extend a vote of appreciation to Elder Goaslind for his dedicated service may do so by the uplifted hand.</p>
<p>We sustain as the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy Dean L. Larsen, Richard G. Scott, Marion D. Hanks, William Grant Bangerter, Robert L. Backman, Hugh W. Pinnock, and James M. Paramore.</p>
<p>Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain all of the other General Authorities and general officers of the Church as at present constituted.</p>
<p>Those in favor please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>President Benson, it appears that the voting has been unanimous in the affirmative.</p>
