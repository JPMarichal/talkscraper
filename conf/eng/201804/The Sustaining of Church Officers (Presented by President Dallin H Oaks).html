<p>I will now present some changes in Church leadership and the General Officers and Area Seventies of the Church for sustaining vote, after which Brother Kevin R. Jergensen, managing director of the Church Auditing Department, will read the audit report.</p>
<p>Given their calls to serve as new members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, it is proposed that we release Elders Gerrit W. Gong and Ulisses Soares from serving as members of the Presidency of the Seventy.</p>
<p>In addition, we extend releases to Elders Craig C. Christensen, Lynn G. Robbins, and Juan A. Uceda from their service as members of the Presidency of the Seventy, to be effective August 1, 2018.</p>

<p>Those who wish to join us in expressing appreciation to these Brethren for their willing service may do so with the uplifted hand.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we release, with heartfelt gratitude, Sisters Bonnie L. Oscarson, Carol F. McConkie, and Neill F. Marriott as the Young Women General Presidency. We likewise extend releases to members of the Young Women general board, who have served so well.</p>
<p>All who wish to join us in expressing appreciation to these sisters for their remarkable service and devotion, please manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we release Sister Bonnie H. Cordon from serving as First Counselor in the Primary General Presidency.</p>

<p>Those opposed, if any.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Bonnie H. Cordon to serve as Young Women General President, with Michelle Lynn Craig as First Counselor and Rebecca Lynn Craven as Second Counselor.</p>

<p>Those opposed, if any.</p>
<p>President Nelson, the voting has been noted. We invite those who may have opposed any of the proposals to contact their stake presidents.</p>
<p>With the sustaining that has just taken place, we now have 116 General Authorities. Nearly 40 percent of them were born outside the United States—in Germany, Brazil, Mexico, New Zealand, Scotland, Canada, South Korea, Guatemala, Argentina, Italy, Zimbabwe, Uruguay, Peru, South Africa, American Samoa, England, Puerto Rico, Australia, Venezuela, Kenya, the Philippines, Portugal, Fiji, China, Japan, Chile, Colombia, and France.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, we thank you for your continued faith and prayers in behalf of the leaders of the Church.</p>
<p>We now invite the new General Authority Seventies, the new Young Women General Presidency, and Sister Harkness of the Primary General Presidency to take their seats on the rostrum.</p>
