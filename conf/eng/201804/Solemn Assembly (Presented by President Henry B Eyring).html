        <p>Brothers and sisters, President Nelson has asked that I handle the business of the solemn assembly for which we are gathered today.</p>
<p>This is an occasion of great significance for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout the world.</p>
<p>Dating from October 10, 1880, when John Taylor was sustained to succeed Brigham Young as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, each of these occasions has been designated as a formal solemn assembly of the body of the Church to express the voice of the Church.</p>
<p>We will vote by quorums and groups. Wherever you are, you are invited to stand only when requested and express by your uplifted hand that you choose to sustain those whose names will be presented. You should vote only when asked to stand.</p>
<p>The General Authorities assigned to the Tabernacle and the Assembly Hall on Temple Square will observe the voting in those facilities. In stake centers, a member of the stake presidency will observe the voting. If anyone casts a contrary vote, those individuals should contact their respective stake presidents.</p>
<p>We will now proceed. Again, please stand and vote only when asked to do so.</p>
<p>We ask members of the First Presidency to please arise.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the First Presidency sustain Russell Marion Nelson as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
