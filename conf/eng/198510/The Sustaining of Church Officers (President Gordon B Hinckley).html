        <p>My brothers and sisters, I shall now present to you the General Authorities and general officers of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain President Spencer W. Kimball as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed, by the same sign. Marion G. Romney as First Counselor in the First Presidency and Gordon B. Hinckley as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. All in favor, please signify. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain as President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles Elder Ezra Taft Benson, and the following as members of that council: Ezra Taft Benson, Howard W. Hunter, Thomas S. Monson, Boyd K. Packer, Marvin J. Ashton, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, James E. Faust, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, and M. Russell Ballard. It is proposed that we sustain the counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed may so manifest it.</p>
<p>We have asked Elder J. Thomas Fyans, a man of great ability and great faith, to go to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to serve as Area President of the South America South Area of the Church. He and his wife will be traveling there shortly. And I’d like to say that we have no more faithful or competent man in the Church, and the marvelous thing is he speaks Spanish.</p>
<p>We also release Elder M. Russell Ballard, who, along with Elder Fyans, has served as a President in the First Quorum of the Seventy. All who wish to extend a vote of appreciation to these Brethren who have served so faithfully in these capacities may do so.</p>
<p>We sustain as the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy: Carlos E. Asay, Dean L. Larsen, Richard G. Scott, Marion D. Hanks, William Grant Bangerter, Jack H Goaslind Jr., and Robert L. Backman. All other members of the First Quorum of the Seventy, the Presiding Bishopric, the emeritus brethren, and all general officers of the Church as at present constituted. All in favor, please signify. Any who may feel opposed may so indicate.</p>
<p>It appears that the voting has been unanimous in the affirmative. Thank you.</p>
