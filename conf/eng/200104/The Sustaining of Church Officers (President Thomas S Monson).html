        <p>My dear brothers and sisters, President Hinckley has requested that I now present to you the General Authorities, Area Authority Seventies, and general auxiliary presidencies of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Gordon Bitner Hinckley as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Thomas Spencer Monson as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and James Esdras Faust as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed, if any, may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Thomas Spencer Monson as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Boyd Kenneth Packer as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; and the following as members of that quorum: Boyd K. Packer, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, Richard G. Scott, Robert D. Hales, Jeffrey R. Holland, and Henry B. Eyring. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. All in favor may please manifest it. Opposed, if any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Elders Claudio R. M. Costa, Richard J. Maynes, L. Whitney Clayton, Christoffel Golden Jr., Walter F. González, and Steven E. Snow as new members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the following as new members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy: Keith K. Hilbig, Robert F. Orton, Wayne S. Peterson, R. Conrad Schultz, Robert R. Steuer, and H. Ross Workman. Those in favor, please manifest it. Opposed, if any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the following as Area Authority Seventies: Salvador Aguirre, Daniel P. Alvarez, David J. Barnett, Oscar W. Chavez, Craig C. Christensen, Carl B. Cook, R. Michael Duffin, Timothy Dyches, Michael H. Holmes, Richard D. May, Joel H. McKinnon, Jorge Mendez, Marcus B. Nash, Timothy M. Olson, Richard G. Peterson, Gary L. Pocock, Armando A. Sierra, Gary M. Stewart, G. Perrin Walker, Robert B. White, Larry Y. Wilson, and Kazuhiko Yamashita. All in favor will please manifest it by raising the right hand. Opposed, if any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities, Area Authority Seventies, and general auxiliary presidencies as presently constituted. All in favor may manifest it. Opposed, if any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It appears, President Hinckley, that the sustaining has been unanimous in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your continued faith and prayers.</p>
<p>We shall now ask that the newly called members of the First and Second Quorums of the Seventy take their places on the stand.</p>
