        <p>My brothers and sisters, I shall now present to you the General Authorities and general officers of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Ezra Taft Benson as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Gordon B. Hinckley as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and Thomas S. Monson as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed, if any, may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Howard W. Hunter as President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles and the following as members of that council: Howard W. Hunter, Boyd K. Packer, Marvin J. Ashton, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, James E. Faust, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, and Richard G. Scott. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. All in favor, please manifest it. Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>Brother Heber B. Kapp, husband of Sister Ardeth G. Kapp, has been called to preside over the Canada Vancouver Mission. It will therefore be necessary to release her as general president of the Young Women. We also release her counselors, Jayne B. Malan and Janette C. Hales, and all members of the Young Women general board.</p>
<p>All who wish to join in a true expression of profound appreciation to these sisters for their excellent service may do so by the uplifted hand.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Sister Janette C. Hales as general president of the Young Women, with Virginia H. Pearce as first counselor and Patricia P. Pinegar as second counselor. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities and general officers of the Church as presently constituted. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed may manifest it.</p>
<p>It appears that the voting has been unanimous in the affirmative.</p>
<p>Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your continued vote of love and confidence.</p>
<p>We invite the newly called Young Women general presidency to take their places on the stand at this time.</p>
