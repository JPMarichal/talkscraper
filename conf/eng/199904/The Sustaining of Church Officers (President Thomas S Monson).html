        <p>My brothers and sisters, President Hinckley has requested that I, Brother Monson, now present to you the General Authorities, Area Authority Seventies, and general auxiliary presidencies of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Gordon Bitner Hinckley as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Thomas Spencer Monson as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and James Esdras Faust as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed, if any, may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Thomas Spencer Monson as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Boyd Kenneth Packer as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the following as members of that quorum: Boyd K. Packer, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, Richard G. Scott, Robert D. Hales, Jeffrey R. Holland, and Henry B. Eyring. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. All in favor, please manifest it. Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>Those who can join with us in extending a vote of appreciation to Elders Adhemar Damiani, Ernani Teixeira, and Robert S. Wood for their service as Area Authority Seventies, please manifest it. Thank you.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Elders Adhemar Damiani, Stephen B. Oveson, David R. Stone, H. Bruce Stucki, Richard H. Winkel, and Robert S. Wood as members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy. All who wish to join with us in doing so, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Elders Benjamin De Hoyos, Steven E. Snow, and Pedro Jorge da Cruz Penha as Area Authority Seventies. All in favor, please manifest it. Thank you. Any opposed, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities, Area Authority Seventies, and general auxiliary presidencies as at present constituted. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed may so manifest it.</p>
<p>It appears that the sustaining has been unanimous in the affirmative. Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your faith and your prayers.</p>
<p>We shall now ask the newly called members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy to take their places on the stand.</p>
