        <p>As requested by President Benson and announced by President Hinckley, I shall now present to you the General Authorities and general officers of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Ezra Taft Benson as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Gordon B. Hinckley as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and Thomas S. Monson as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Howard W. Hunter as President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles and the following as members of that council: Howard W. Hunter, Boyd K. Packer, Marvin J. Ashton, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, James E. Faust, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, and Richard G. Scott. Those in favor, please manifest it. Opposed, if any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
<p>All in favor, please. Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities of the Church as presently constituted with the following additional brethren as new members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy: Eduardo Ayala, LeGrand R. Curtis, Clinton L. Cutler, Robert K. Dellenbach, Harold G. Hillam, Kenneth Johnson, Helvécio Martins, Lynn A. Mickelsen, J Ballard Washburn, and Durrel A. Woolsey.</p>
<p>Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>We release with our heartfelt thanks Brother David M. Kennedy, who has served as special representative of the First Presidency since 1974, and Brother Blaine C. Tueller, who has served as his assistant. Those who wish to join us in this expression of appreciation, please manifest it.</p>
<p>Sister Barbara W. Winder has accepted a call to accompany her husband, Richard, to his assignment as president of the Czechoslovakia Prague Mission. It is therefore necessary to release her as general president of the Relief Society. We also release her counselors, Joy F. Evans and Joanne B. Doxey, and all members of the Relief Society general board. In addition, we release Sister Elaine L. Jack as second counselor in the Young Women General Presidency. All who wish to join in an expression of appreciation to these sisters for their excellent service may do so by the uplifted hand.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Sister Elaine Low Jack as general president of the Relief Society with Chieko N. Okazaki as first counselor and Aileen H. Clyde as second counselor. Those in favor please manifest it. Any opposed by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain as second counselor in the Young Women General Presidency Sister Janette C. Hales.</p>
<p>All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other general officers of the Church as presently constituted.</p>
<p>Those in favor please manifest it. Opposed, if any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>President Benson, it appears that the voting has been unanimous in the affirmative.</p>
<p>We invite the newly called members of the Seventy and general women’s presidencies to take their places on the stand at this time.</p>
