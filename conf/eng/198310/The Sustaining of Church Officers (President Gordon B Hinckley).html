        <p>In view of his recent call to serve as the president of the Washington D.C. Temple, we hearby extend to Elder Franklin D. Richards an honorable release as one of the Presidents of the First Quorum of the Seventy. He has served as the Senior President of that quorum since it was organized.</p>
<p>Also in view of the call of Sister Shirley W. Thomas to assist her husband in his duties as president of the Australia Melbourne Mission, we extend to her an honorable release from her service as the second counselor in the Relief Society general presidency.</p>
<p>All who wish to join in extending a sincere vote of thanks and appreciation to Elder Richards and Sister Thomas for their remarkable service, please indicate by the uplifted hand. Thank you.</p>
<p>It is proposed that Elder Richard G. Scott be called as one of the Presidents of the First Quorum of the Seventy, filling the vacancy created by the release of Elder Franklin D. Richards.</p>
<p>Those in favor manifest it by the uplifted hand. Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It also is proposed that Sister Ann Stoddard Reese succeed Sister Shirley W. Thomas as the second counselor in the Relief Society general presidency.</p>
<p>All in favor please manifest it by the uplifted hand. Any opposed by the same sign.</p>
<p>With these exceptions, there have been no changes in the General Authorities or general officers of the Church since the last general conference. It is proposed, therefore, that we sustain all of the General Authorities and general officers of the Church as at present constituted.</p>
<p>All in favor manifest it by the uplifted hand. Any opposed may so manifest it. Thank you.</p>
