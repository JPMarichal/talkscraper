        <p>My dear brethren, I am honored by the privilege to address you in this worldwide gathering of faithful holders of the priesthood of God. This evening I reference a topic about which I have spoken before.</p>
<p>The prophet Mormon outlined one of the key characteristics of the Savior and which is to be emulated by His disciples. Said he:</p>
<p>“And if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.</p>
<p>“And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked. …</p>
<p>“Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail—</p>
<p>“But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.”<a class="note-link" href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Brethren, we do not honor the priesthood of God if we are not kind to others.</p>
<p>My dear friend and associate Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin was truly a kind man. Said he:</p>
<p>“Kindness is the essence of a celestial life. Kindness is how a Christlike person treats others. Kindness should permeate all of our words and actions at work, at school, at church, and especially in our homes.</p>
<p>“Jesus, our Savior, was the epitome of kindness and compassion.”<a class="note-link" href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The scriptures teach us that the righteous exercise of the priesthood is dependent upon our living the principles of kindness, charity, and <span class="page-break" data-page="67"></span>love. In the Doctrine and Covenants we read:</p>
<p>“No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, … by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;</p>
<p>“By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile.”<a class="note-link" href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Brethren, let us examine our lives and determine to follow the Savior’s example by being kind, loving, and charitable. And as we do so, we will be in a better position to call down the powers of heaven for ourselves, for our families, and for our fellow travelers in this sometimes difficult journey back to our heavenly home. I so pray in the name of Jesus Christ the Lord, amen.</p>
