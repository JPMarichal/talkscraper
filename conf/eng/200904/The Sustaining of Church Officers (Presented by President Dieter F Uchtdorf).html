<p>Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your sustaining vote and for your faith, devotion, and prayers.</p>
<p>We invite Elder Hallstrom, the newly called members of the Seventy, and the new Sunday School and Young Men general presidencies to take their places on the stand.</p>
<p>We welcome all of them, as well as Elder Andersen, who became this morning the 97th Apostle to serve in this dispensation. The calling of an Apostle, as you know, goes back to the Lord Jesus Christ. And those Seventies you just see walking up there are the ones the scriptures call for that the Twelve should call on before any other (see D&C 107:38).</p>
<p>Thank you, brethren.</p>
