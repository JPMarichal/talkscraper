        <p>Brothers and sisters, as announced, I will now present the General Authorities, Area Seventies, and General Officers of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>Please express your vote in the usual way wherever you may be. If there are those who oppose any of the proposals, we ask that you contact your stake president.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Russell Marion Nelson as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Dallin Harris Oaks as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and Henry Bennion Eyring as Second Counselor in the First Presidency.</p>
<p>Those in favor may manifest it.</p>
<p>Those opposed, if any, may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Dallin H. Oaks as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and M. Russell Ballard as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.</p>

<p>We note that Elder Dean M. Davies, who passed away on August 31, 2021, would have been released as a General Authority Seventy this conference. We extend to Sister Darla Davies and to the family our heartfelt condolences and appreciation for Elder Davies’s tireless service.</p>
<p>We also note with appreciation the Area Seventies who have completed their service during this past year.</p>
<p>Those who wish to join in expressing gratitude to these brethren for their excellent service may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities, Area Seventies—including two new Area Seventies announced earlier this week in newsroom.ChurchofJesusChrist.org—and General Officers as presently constituted.</p>
<p>All in favor, please manifest it.</p>
