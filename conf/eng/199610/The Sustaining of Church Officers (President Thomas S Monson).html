        <p>My dear brothers and sisters, President Hinckley has asked that I, Brother Monson, now present to you the General Authorities and general auxiliary presidencies of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Gordon Bitner Hinckley as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Thomas Spencer Monson as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and James Esdras Faust as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed, if any, may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Thomas Spencer Monson as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Boyd Kenneth Packer as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the following as members of that quorum: Boyd K. Packer, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, Richard G. Scott, Robert D. Hales, Jeffrey R. Holland, and Henry B. Eyring. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we extend an official vote of appreciation to Elder Carlos E. Asay and that he be designated as an emeritus member of the First Quorum of the Seventy and released as a member of the Presidency of the Quorums of the Seventy. Those who wish to join in an expression of appreciation, please manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Elder Earl C. Tingey as a member of the Presidency of the Quorums of the Seventy. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>With gratitude for their service as General Authorities, we extend an honorable release to Elders W. Mack Lawrence, Rulon G. Craven, Joseph C. Muren, Graham W. Doxey, Jorge A. Rojas, Julio E. Dávila, Han In Sang, Stephen D. Nadauld, and Sam K. Shimabukuro as members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy. Those who wish to join in an expression of appreciation, please indicate by the uplifted hand.</p>
<p>Those who may wish to join us in releasing with a vote of thanks Elder Stephen D. Nadauld as first counselor in the Young Men general presidency and Elder Vaughn J Featherstone as second counselor, please manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain as counselors to Jack H Goaslind, the president of the Young Men, Elder Vaughn J Featherstone as first counselor in the Young Men general presidency and Elder F. David Stanley as second counselor. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities and general auxiliary presidencies as presently constituted. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It appears, President Hinckley, that the sustaining has been unanimous in the affirmative. Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your loving and prayerful support.</p>
