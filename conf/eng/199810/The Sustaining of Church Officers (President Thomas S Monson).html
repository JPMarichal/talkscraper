        <p>My brothers and sisters, President Hinckley has requested that I now present to you the General Authorities, Area Authority Seventies, and general auxiliary presidencies of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Gordon Bitner Hinckley as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Thomas Spencer Monson as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and James Esdras Faust as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Those opposed, if any, may manifest.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Thomas Spencer Monson as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Boyd Kenneth Packer as Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the following as members of that quorum: Boyd K. Packer, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, Richard G. Scott, Robert D. Hales, Jeffrey R. Holland, and Henry B. Eyring. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators. All in favor may manifest it. Contrary, if there be any, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we extend an official vote of appreciation to Elders Jack H Goaslind, W. Eugene Hansen, James M. Paramore, and Ronald E. Poelman and designate them as emeritus members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. All who wish to join with us in doing so, please manifest. Thank you.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we release with a vote of thanks Elders Monte J. Brough, W. Eugene Hansen, and Jack H Goaslind as Presidents of the Quorums of the Seventy; Elders Jack H Goaslind, Robert K. Dellenbach, and F. Melvin Hammond as the Young Men general presidency; and Elder Glenn L. Pace as first counselor and Elder Neil L. Andersen as second counselor in the Sunday School general presidency. Those who wish to join in an expression of appreciation to all for their services, please make it known.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Elders D. Todd Christofferson, Marlin K. Jensen, and David E. Sorensen as members of the Presidency of the Quorums of the Seventy. All in favor, please manifest. Any opposed, by the same sign.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Elder Neil L. Andersen as first counselor and Elder John H. Groberg as second counselor in the Sunday School general presidency, and Elders Robert K. Dellenbach, F. Melvin Hammond, and John M. Madsen as the Young Men general presidency. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities, Area Authority Seventies, and general auxiliary presidencies as presently constituted. Those in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed may similarly manifest it.</p>
<p>It appears, President Hinckley, that the sustaining has been unanimous in the affirmative. Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your faith and your prayers.</p>
