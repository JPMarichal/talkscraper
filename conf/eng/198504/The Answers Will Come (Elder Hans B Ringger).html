        <p>Elder Packer taught us two days ago, that in the early years of the Church, the Saints would sometimes get a letter from “Box B.” A letter from Box B meant you were getting a calling without being interviewed first. Presidents of the Church called members on missions with no warning beforehand. I feel the same way today.</p>
<p>It’s a long way from Switzerland to this stand in Salt Lake City. I had to cross many borders. I had to ask for a visa, for permission to enter this country. But I found out that wherever I had to cross a border or had to talk with people, the people were friendly. That’s exactly what I need in my assignment—friends. I have some sitting behind me. I have some sitting before me.</p>
<p>I’m really happy to be here and to serve. I don’t know at the moment all the questions I will be asked or how I will find solutions for them. But I know that I will get an answer when I work on it and pray about it. If I do that, I know I will be blessed in all I do.</p>
<p>I am very thankful for my priesthood leaders, my parents, my sisters, my brethren, my teachers in Sunday School—all who have given me the strength to fulfill the assignments I get in my life. Hopefully, I can serve so that our Lord will be pleased. I am very thankful to the First Presidency for this privilege—for calling me to be a General Authority. I leave you my testimony that I know that our Lord lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a true prophet. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
