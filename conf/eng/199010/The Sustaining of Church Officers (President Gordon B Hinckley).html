        <p>My brothers and sisters, I shall now present to you the General Authorities and general officers of the Church for your sustaining vote.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Ezra Taft Benson as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Gordon B. Hinckley as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and Thomas S. Monson as Second Counselor in the First Presidency.</p>
<p>Those in favor may manifest it.</p>
<p>Any opposed may manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Howard W. Hunter as President of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, and the following as members of that council: Howard W. Hunter, Boyd K. Packer, Marvin J. Ashton, L. Tom Perry, David B. Haight, James E. Faust, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, Joseph B. Wirthlin, and Richard G. Scott.</p>
<p>Those in favor, please manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the Counselors in the First Presidency and the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators.</p>
<p>All in favor, please manifest it.</p>
<p>With gratitude for their service as General Authorities for the past five and one-half years, it is proposed that we release Elders Waldo P. Call and Helio R. Camargo as members of the Second Quorum of the Seventy. Those who wish to join in expressing appreciation, please indicate by the uplifted hand.</p>
<p>As has been previously announced, these brethren have accepted calls to serve as presidents of the Mexico City and Sao Paulo Brazil temples respectively.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we release with a vote of thanks Elders Vaughn J. Featherstone, Jeffrey R. Holland, and Monte J. Brough as the Young Men General Presidency and Elder Ted E. Brewerton as Second Counselor in the Sunday School General Presidency.</p>
<p>I wish to note that these releases are made necessary because of other assignments.</p>
<p>Those who wish to join in a vote of appreciation may do so.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain Elders Jack H Goaslind, LeGrand R. Curtis, and Robert K. Dellenbach as the Young Men General Presidency and Elder H. Verlan Andersen as Second Counselor in the Sunday School General Presidency.</p>
<p>All in favor, manifest it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that we sustain the other General Authorities and general officers of the Church as presently constituted.</p>
<p>It appears that the voting has been unanimous in the affirmative. We thank you, our beloved brothers and sisters, for your continued vote of confidence and love.</p>
