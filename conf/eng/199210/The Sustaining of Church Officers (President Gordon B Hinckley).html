Architectural work is proceeding, looking in the near future to the construction of the temples in St. Louis, Missouri; Bogotá, Colombia; and Guayaquil, Ecuador.</p>
<p>We are also pleased to announce that property has been designated for the construction of a new temple in Hong Kong to serve the needs of our people in that great area of Asia; and another in Hartford, Connecticut, to accommodate Church members from the New York, Boston, and New England areas; and also another temple in Utah County to relieve the pressure on the Provo Temple, which is operating far beyond its designed capacity. We anticipate that there will be others, the locations of which will be announced later.</p>
