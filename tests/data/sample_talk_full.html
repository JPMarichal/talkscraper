            <p>My dear brothers and sisters, I speak to you today about the fundamental principle of faith and its transformative power in our lives.</p>
            
            <p>Faith is not merely belief; it is a principle of action and power<sup class="marker" data-note-id="note1">1</sup>. When we exercise faith, we invite divine power into our lives.</p>
            
            <p>As the Apostle Paul taught, "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen"<sup class="marker" data-note-id="note2">2</sup>. This eternal truth guides us through life's challenges.</p>
            
            <h2>Faith in Action</h2>
            <p>True faith manifests itself through our actions. When we act in faith, we demonstrate our trust in God's plan for us.</p>
            
            <p>I testify that faith in Jesus Christ has the power to heal, to comfort, and to guide us home to our Heavenly Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>
